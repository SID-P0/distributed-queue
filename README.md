**Running the project in local**
1. docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build
2. docker compose -f docker-compose-infra.yml up -d (Ignore if you dont want to re-link and replicate all the infra to run it locally)

**IF YOU WANT TO RUN INFRA YOU MUST RUN DEV ENV IN ORDER TO LOCALLY SUPPORT NETWORK BRIDGE**
