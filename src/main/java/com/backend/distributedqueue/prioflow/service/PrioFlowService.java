     * Atomically claims the best available priority rank from a shared pool in Redis.
     * <p>
     * This method resolves the critical challenge of assigning a unique resource in a distributed environment.
     * It uses the Redis `ZPOPMIN` command, an atomic write operation that guarantees a single rank
     * can only be claimed once across all service instances.
     * <p>
     * SCALING STRATEGY:
     * This implementation uses a single, well known key in Redis (e.g., "available_ranks"). This is simple
     * and highly performant for most use cases.
     * <p>
     * If this single key ever becomes a "hot key" bottleneck under extreme load (proven by monitoring),
     * the system can be scaled further by implementing client-side sharding: creating multiple rank pools
     * (e.g., "available_ranks_1", "available_ranks_2") and having the application randomly pick a pool
     * to claim a rank from. This would distribute the write load across the entire Redis cluster.
     * <p>
     * Alternatively we can do pessimistic-lock on rows from the database and assign the keys accordingly we
